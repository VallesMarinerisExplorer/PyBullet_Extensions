PyBullet is a great python library for physics and rigid body simulation.

To use PyBullet without having to download Visual Studio, etc.

1. Download pybullet.YOUR_PYTHON_VERSION.pyd.
2. Move this .pyd file into your python environment's "site-packages" directory. 
3. Download and unzip pybullet-download.zip
4. Move the extracted subfolders (pybullet_data, pybullet_envs, etc) into this same "site-packages" directory.

    This should work. Let me know if it doesn't.
