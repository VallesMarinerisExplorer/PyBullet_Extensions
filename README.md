To use PyBullet without downloading Visual Studio or C++ build tools or any of that, download pybullet_YOUR_PYTHON_VERSION.pyd and put it in your python environment's "site-packages" directory. Then, download and unzip
pybullet-download.zip and extract the subfolders into the same "site-packages" directory as well. This should work. Let me know if it doesn't.

Here is a link to the original PyBullet/Bullet repository: https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3
